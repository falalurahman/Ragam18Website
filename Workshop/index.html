            <p>The old saying goes that 'a picture is worth a thousand words'. Great photographs are one that tell a
                story or convey a message. This workshop aims to equip photographers to tell stories with their
                cameras, the process involved in identifying and conceptualizing the stories, executing them
                efficiently and presenting them effectively. It helps participants to understand the complete
                workflow involved in making a visual story, equips them to create photo-projects and bring it to
                completion. The program facilitates the thought process of building a 'narrative' with images, which
                involves critical analysis of the participant's body of work, underlining the importance of editing and
                eventually encouraging them to choose a creative path that will be individualistic.</p>

            <p>Participants will learn how hackers break into the systems and websites so as to make them aware of the

                able to create a virtual wall between their data and the penetrators (hackers). This workshop will enable
                you to carry out attacking as well defensive methodologies which will help you not only protect but also
                assess your safety and vulnerability ratio. This is a Penetration Testing &amp; Information Security Workshop.
                Learning can be through theory and practice when theory is put into practice, there is a thin line between
                perfection and distortion. The workshops provide you an intensive session which will empower you with
                knowledge; that is inaccessible to most, in a simplified and easily graspable manner. The objective is to
                provide web security to any and every user of the internet. We envisage a world where all Internet users
                are at a level footing. No one should be able take advantage or be taken advantage of by porous web

                The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, and other items embedded
                with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects
                to collect and exchange data. The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across
                existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical
                world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic
